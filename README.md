# A*(Star) Visualizer
A visualizer for the A*(star) shortest pathfinding algorithm.

# Instructions:
After running the program, the console will prompt you for the length and height of the grid/window.

Type the values and hit enter for each.

It will then prompt you as to whether you will like the heuristic functions in the A*(star) algorithm to be calculated with the Manhattan distance or the Euclidian distance.

indicate your selection and hit enter.

Upon inputting the values, a window will then be created where you can draw the start, target, and barriers.

The first left click will determine the starting position.

The next left click will determine the target's position.

The rest of the left clicks/drag and click will be used to draw barriers in the window.

Right-click can be used to delete any of the drawn items and left-click can be used to redraw them in the same order as specified above.

Press the space bar on your keyboard when you want to begin the path-finding algorithm.

If you can clear the window to its default state, press 'q' on the keyboard.

# Note
The red shows the expanding area that the A*(star) algorithm is exploring.

The orange shows the area that it has already explored.

The white indicates barriers that the algorithm must go around.

The green represents starting position.

The purple represents the target position.

The light blue and dark green pattern represents the final "shortest" discovered path from the start position to the target position.
